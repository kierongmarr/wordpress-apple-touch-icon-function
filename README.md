Wordpress apple touch icon function
===================================

This function can be copied and pasted into your Wordpress functions file and will include your apple touch icons automatically.

How it works
-----------------------------------
You simply need to:
1. Create your apple touch icons and name them
..1. apple-touch-icon.png
..2. apple-touch-icon-57x57.png
..3. apple-touch-icon-72x72.png
..4. apple-touch-icon-114x114.png
..5. apple-touch-icon-144x144.png

2. Alternatively you can include precomposed versions of your apple touch icons by adding '-precomposed' onto the end of the filename after the size. eg: 'apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed'
3. Include them either in the sites root or theme directory.
