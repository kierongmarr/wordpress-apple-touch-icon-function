Wordpress apple touch icon function
===================================

This function can be copied and pasted into your Wordpress functions file and will include your apple touch icons automatically.

How it works
-----------------------------------
You simply need to

1. Copy the function to your Wordpress functions.php file.
2. Create your apple touch icons and name them:
  1. apple-touch-icon.png
  2. apple-touch-icon-57x57.png
  3. apple-touch-icon-72x72.png
  4. apple-touch-icon-114x114.png
  5. apple-touch-icon-144x144.png
3. Alternatively you can include precomposed versions of your apple touch icons by adding '-precomposed' onto the end of the filename after the size. i.e. 'apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed'.
4. Include them either in the sites root or theme directory.
